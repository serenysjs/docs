<Note>
	You usually don't need to use the REST API directly. We provide
	[SDKs](/sdks/overview) to use Serenys with various languages and frameworks.
	The primary reason you'll need to use the REST API directly is if you're
	writing a Serenys API wrapper in a language which we don't have SDK support
	for yet.
