You can interface with Serenys's API either over REST, or via libraries for certain
languages. Below is a list of our official, supported libraries.

### Server Side

| Name    | Language   | URL                                                                | Official | Documentation                      |

| serenys | TypeScript | [npmjs.com/package/serenys](https://www.npmjs.com/package/serenys) | âœ…       | [/sdks/server/js](/sdks/server/js) |

### API REST

We don't have SDK support for every language out there - _yet_. So, if you'd
like to use our REST API directly, we have documentation on how to use that
[here](/reference/rest-api).
